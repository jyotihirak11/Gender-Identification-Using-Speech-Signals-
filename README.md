# Gender-Identification-Using-Speech-Signals


In our work we have tried to identify the gender of a speaker using speech signal properties. 

I have done the coding on Jupyter Notebook, so I have attested the print out version.

To see the coding, check out the MCA.py file.
 
I have used speech signal of audio samples of .FLAC file(around 404 audios are there in total). You can check the voices folder. 

I have used the csv file voicesample1.csv for labelling the audio data.
